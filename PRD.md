## 1. Problem Statement

India loses approximately ₹8-10 lakh crore annually to crop failures caused by preventable factors including drought stress, pest infestations, and nutrient deficiencies. While satellite imagery, soil sensors, and historical weather patterns contain powerful predictive signals that could enable early intervention, the majority of Indian farmers lack the technical tools, literacy, and infrastructure to interpret this data and take preemptive action.

The current agricultural advisory ecosystem in India suffers from three critical gaps:

1. **Information asymmetry**: Weather and satellite data exist in technical formats that are inaccessible to average farmers, who typically have only primary-level education and rely on visual observation and traditional knowledge for crop management decisions.

2. **Language and literacy barriers**: Existing agricultural advisory systems deliver recommendations in English or technical Hindi, assuming a level of literacy and digital fluency that does not reflect the reality of India's farming community—particularly women farmers, who constitute approximately 33% of the agricultural labor force but have significantly lower average educational attainment.

3. **Actionability deficit**: Even when farmers receive risk warnings, the recommendations lack specificity—quantities, timings, and local context—so farmers cannot translate abstract alerts into concrete actions. A warning to "apply fertilizer" is meaningless without knowing what type, how much, when, and at what cost.

FasalRakshak addresses these gaps by building a user-centric system that translates complex remote sensing and weather data into a simple 0-100 crop health score with a 7-day risk forecast, delivers 3-5 hyper-specific interventions in the farmer's preferred language (including Kannada), and provides voice readout capabilities for low-literacy users.

---

## 2. Executive Summary

FasalRakshak is a mobile-first web application that predicts crop failure risk at the district level using publicly available satellite data (NDVI from Sentinel-2/MODIS) and weather data (Open-Meteo API). The system accepts three inputs from the farmer—district location, crop type, and growth stage—and outputs a composite 0-100 crop health score with a 7-day risk forecast, along with 3-5 actionable recommendations generated via Gemini API in English, Hindi, or Kannada. A voice readout feature using Web Speech API enables usage by low-literacy farmers.

The three-channel risk scoring engine differentiates between:

- **Drought stress**: Derived from precipitation deficit, soil moisture estimates, evapotranspiration rates, and NDVI trends.
- **Pest pressure**: Inferred from weather conditions favorable to pest proliferation, historical pest outbreak data, and vegetation stress indicators.
- **Nutrient deficiency**: Estimated from NDVI anomalies relative to crop-specific healthy baselines, precipitation patterns, and soil type proxies.

Key differentiators from existing solutions include: (1) multi-language output including Kannada, (2) voice interface for low-literacy users, (3) differentiation between three distinct risk channels, and (4) quantity-aware recommendations with specific amounts, schedules, and costs.

## 3. User Personas

### 3.1 Persona A: Small and Marginal Indian Farmer

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Name** | Ramesh |
| **Age** | 45 years |
| **Location** | Rural Karnataka (Dharwad District) |
| **Farm Size** | 1.5 acres (marginal farmer) |
| **Primary Crop** | Ragi, Maize, and Vegetables |
| **Education** | 7th standard (primary completed) |
| **Digital Literacy** | Basic—can use WhatsApp, make UPI payments, and consume short videos. Cannot read long-form text comfortably. |
| **Language Preference** | Kannada (native), Hindi (conversational), English (limited) |
| **Pain Points** | Unpredictable monsoon causes crop losses; unable to identify whether yellowing leaves are due to drought, pest, or nutrient deficiency; receives generic advice that does not specify quantities or costs; has to visit the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for advice, which is time-consuming and requires travel. |
| **Goals** | Protect the standing crop from predictable losses; receive specific guidance on water, fertilizer, and pest management that fits his resources; avoid middlemen and input dealers who may recommend unnecessary or expensive products. |
| **User Journey** | Ramesh accesses FasalRakshak via a mobile browser. He selects his district (Dharwad), crop (Ragi), and growth stage (vegetative). He receives a crop health score of 68/100 with a 7-day forecast. The system identifies elevated drought stress (72/100) and recommends specific interventions: (1) Apply 2 liters of water per square meter today and tomorrow morning, (2) Apply neem cake 250 kg/acre as preventive pest control, (3) Top-dress urea 15 kg/acre 5 days after next rain. He clicks the voice button to hear the first two recommendations in Kannada. |

### 3.2 Persona B: Agricultural Extension Officer

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Name** | Dr. Lakshmi Devi |
| **Age** | 38 years |
| **Location** | Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh (originally from Andhra Pradesh) |
| **Role** | Subject Matter Specialist (Crop Science), District Agricultural Extension Office |
| **Organization** | Department of Agriculture, Madhya Pradesh |
| **Education** | M.Sc. in Agronomy, 12 years of field experience |
| **Digital Literacy** | Moderate—uses Kisan Portal, WhatsApp groups, Excel, and can navigate web dashboards. |
| **Language Preference** | Hindi (native), English (working), Telugu (home), Kannada (basic comprehension) |
| **Pain Points** | Overwhelmed by the number of farmers to serve (1 officer per 30,000+ farmers); cannot visit every village regularly; existing advisory systems are too generic and do not account for micro-level variations within a district; lacks real-time data to support field observations with evidence. |
| **Goals** | Scale personalized advisory to more farmers; access district-level risk summaries to prioritize field visits; provide evidence-backed recommendations to farmer groups; track aggregate risk trends to request resource allocation from the state government. |
| **User Journey** | Dr. Lakshmi opens the FasalRakshak dashboard for her district (Rajgarh). She sees a heatmap of crop health scores across villages and identifies three villages with scores below 50. She clicks into each village to see the breakdown by crop and risk channel. She selects a village with high pest pressure and generates a bulk advisory for cotton farmers in the pod formation stage—specifically, a recommendation to apply imidacloprid at 0.3 ml/liter of water within 48 hours, with a warning not to apply during flowering to protect pollinators. She exports this advisory as a PDF in Hindi and shares it via WhatsApp to the village farmer group. |

## 7. Out-of-Scope Items

The following items are explicitly out of scope for the MVP (Version 1.0) and may be considered for Phase 2 or later:

| Item | Reason for Exclusion |
|------|-------------------|
| **User Accounts / Authentication** | Not required for MVP; adds complexity. Data is session-based. |
| **Push Notifications** | Requires accounts and push infrastructure; SMS fallback is cost-prohibitive. |
| **Soil Sensor Integration** | Requires hardware deployment partnerships and maintenance; beyond MVP scope. |
| **Crop Insurance Integration** | Requires regulatory approvals and insurance partner onboarding; business development, not product. |
| **Market Price Integration** | Agricultural market data (Agmarknet) is a separate data ecosystem; out of scope unless integrated via API in Phase 2. |
| **Regional Languages Beyond Hindi and Kannada** | Translation QA and voice synthesis support for Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Bengali requires additional TTS voices and human review. |
| **Farm-Level Precision (Plot-Level NDVI)** | Requires user to draw polygons on a map; adds UI complexity and boundary data requirements. |
| **Historical Pest Outbreak Database** | Requires data partnership with state agriculture departments; manual data entry is unscalable. |
| **Fertilizer and Pesticide Brand Recommendations** | Product endorsements raise regulatory and trust concerns; stick to generic recommendations (e.g., "urea" not "Urea-N"). |
| **Offline Mode Without Cache** | Full offline functionality requires Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation with local storage; MVP uses HTTP caching only. |
| **Weather Alert SMS Integration** | Requires carrier partnerships and transactional SMS costs. |
| **Multi-Day Forecast Beyond 7 Days** | Weather prediction accuracy degrades significantly beyond 7 days; keep to 7 for MVP. |
